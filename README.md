This repository contains the full source code for all of the [Daily Sketches](http://dailysketches.github.io) created in the month of August 2015. This source code is published automatically along with each sketch I add to the [Daily Sketches website](http://dailysketches.github.io).

There are two ways you can browse published sketches:

1. Browse the [published Daily Sketches site](http://dailysketches.github.io), which shows a date-ordered list of all sketches, along with short code snippets for each
2. Look through each of the top-level folders of this repo. Under those folders you'll find a rendering of the sketch along with the full source code used to generate it.

Also under the top-level folders you will find a readme describing how to run the code locally on your machine. You'll find it easiest if you are using Xcode on a Mac.
